This project was developed as a personal academic project for educational purposes only.

You are free to explore, use, and modify the code for learning or academic submissions. However, the system is not intended for production or
commercial use and comes with no warranty or security guarantees.

All features, logic, and implementation are created to simulate a small-scale e-voting system in an academic context.
